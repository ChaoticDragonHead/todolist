This is a project intended to create a basic TODO list web app that can add new entries, cross them off to mark as complete, delete entries, save entries to come back to later, and add notes to add extra context to various TODO list entries.

What has been accomplished so far:
- ToDo list has added the functionality to add and remove items
- Clicking on a checkbox will add a strikethrough effect

What needs to be accomplished:
- Need to add the ability to sort list by different entries
- Need to have the ability to add notes to entries and have the notes specifically linked to entries - this will adjust how the space between various entries are rendered if the notes are long
- Need to add stylization

Note for next time - I have done some rework on the project and how events are handled. It has been fine in general, but this could pose an issue with scaleable projects. Make sure to have things be modular in the future so that adjustments in project goals can be dealt with with minimal rework. Also make sure to add branches for the new features rather than just pushing to main.
